===

* Pairing encouraged (unless you feel _very_ solid in angular routing and components)
* Data API:
  * Access via:
    * `https://pet-store-401.herokuapp.com/api`, or
    * git clone [`https://github.com/martypdx/pet-store-server`](https://github.com/martypdx/pet-store-server)
  * Added Auth endpoints:
    * GET `/api/auth/verify` (returns `{ sucess: true|false }`)
    * POST `/api/auth/signin` (returns `{ token: <token> }`)
    * POST `/api/auth/signup` (returns `{ token: <token> }`)
  * If you need unauthed routes for previous assignment, they are available at `/api/unauth/<resource>`
  * Token passed via header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## New Welcome/Home State

Optional: Add a welcome or home state that does not require auth, and has a call to action for main page

### User Auth

* Token and User Services
* `app.run` with subscription to `$stateChangeStart`
* Configure states to tell which need auth
* `app.config` with http interceptor
* Model Dialog or state for signin/signup
  * Associated components for sign in/up
  * ngDialog will require css, make sure webpack config handles straight css
* logout link


## Rubric *10pts*

* Services *3pts*
* Setup routes, http, and auth (run via `$stateChangeStart`) *3pts*
* Works Correctly *4pts*
